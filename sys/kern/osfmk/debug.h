 * panic Function
 *
 * This function is called when the system encounters a critical error that
 * cannot be recovered. It displays an error message and stops the program.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   str - A format string for the panic message (similar to printf).
 *   ... - Additional arguments that are formatted into the panic message.
 *
 * The function collects the arguments, formats the panic message, and then
 * calls 'panic_trap_to_debugger' to handle the actual panic process.
